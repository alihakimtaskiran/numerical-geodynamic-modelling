# numerical-geodynamic-modelling

Here I'll try to implement the exercises in Taras Gerya's "Introduction to Numerical Geodynamic Modelling" book with Python.

notes: I have issues with some plottings in the mantle velocity field notebook. For some reason, I could not turn the y axis upside down in the velocity field plot.
It doesn't really make a difference normally, but that way it doesn't represent depth as the human mind comprehends it.
Also, the Gradient plot does not look as it should be for some reason. I didn't really know how to take the gradient of something directly so I ended up summing the partial derivatives for that.
If any of you can help me out with these plotting problems I would really appreciate it.
